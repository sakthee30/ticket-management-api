# 🎟️ Ticket Management API

This project is a backend API application built using FastAPI to manage movie ticket booking workflows.  
It provides APIs for user authentication, movie and theatre management, showtime scheduling, seat booking, and payment handling.

The system is designed with a clear structure, database-driven logic, and real-world backend workflows.

## 📦 Project Overview

The Ticket Management API allows users to:

- Register and authenticate using JWT-based authentication
- Browse movies, theatres, and available showtimes
- Book tickets for a selected show
- Make payments for bookings
- Track booking and payment status
- Access admin-specific APIs for monitoring bookings

All interactions are handled through RESTful APIs.
