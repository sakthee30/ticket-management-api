# 🎟️ Movie Ticket Management API

This project is a backend API application built using FastAPI to manage movie ticket booking workflows.  
It provides APIs for user authentication, movie and theatre management, showtime scheduling, seat booking, and payment handling and AI-powered movie recommendations.

The system is designed with a clear structure, database-driven logic, and real-world backend workflows.
